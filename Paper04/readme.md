**Objective**: Create a machine learning model that is able to classify whether a cyberbully is targeting a victimâ€™s age, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other quality.

**Challenge**: Existing datasets have severe class imbalances.

### **Solutions:**

**Balanced Data Generation**: 
  - Introduces a semi-supervised online Dynamic Query Expansion (DQE) process to generate more balanced datasets.
  - Focuses on extracting data from Twitter.

**Classification Model**: 
  - Uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) classifier.
  - Constructs a graph based on cosine similarities between tweet embeddings.

**Questions that will be answered:**

  - Is DQE a better alternative to oversampling/downsampling?
  - Can we achieve fine-grained classification of hateful tweets?
  - How does a GCN graph structure compare to traditional classifiers?

**Proposed Solution**

  - Developing an online Dynamic Query Expansion process using concatenated keyword search.
  - Semantic Cosine Similarity Graph Convolutional Network (SOSNet). A GCN-based framework that takes in a graph generated by the thresholded semantic cosine similarities between every tweet, allowing for the effective propagation of labels across tweets with similar main ideas. This helps combat the sparsity of textual data.
